## Setup
### Dependencies
All dependencies needed for the project should already be installed in your workspace, but they are also at the top of the notebook in case you need to re-install for any reason.

### Tavily

Sign up for a free Tavily account, which will allow you to search the web and get back N pages and textual content for the pages, for free (first 1000 requests are free)

After signing up, you can get your API key here: https://app.tavily.com/home

### OpenAI
An OpenAI key should be provided to you by Udacity.

### config.env
Create a file named `config.env` in the same directory as the starter notebook.  

Use this config.env to house your api keys for OpenAI and Tavily.
